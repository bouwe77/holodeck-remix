Let's talk about testing

---

I like testing

---

How we test (frontend)

- Unit, integration, E2E

- Pyramid vs Diamond

---

Problem/challenges with our (frontend) tests

- Mocking

- No E2E

- UI/UX, graphics

- Devices, browsers

---

Which is why we test manually as well

---

Problem: Manual tests are done by humans

---

Humans can be busy, forgetting, tired, inexperienced, unaware, lazy, careless, too familiar, assuming, etc , etc. 

---

Consequence

- Coverage

- Consistency

- Repetitiveness 

---

Advantage: Manual tests are done by humans

---

UI/UX, colors, typography, thinking out of the box, monkey testing

---

Manual tests are invaluable

---

- Problems of manual testing can be solved with automation

- Focus of manual testing should be less on on "does it even work", but mainly on the things I just mentioned that are the strong points of humans...

---

Manual vs automated tests?

- Ratio

- Criteria

Ratio depends on criteria 

---

Criteria 

- Time

- Suitability 

- Quality 

- Tooling and skills

---

Next steps

- Write regression scripts for manual testing 

- Write automated E2E tests for the frontend 

- Depending how this goes: Decide the ratio between these 2

# Where to start?

- Core functionality: Hosting and watching webinars

- Payment

- Untested things because they are hard to automate
