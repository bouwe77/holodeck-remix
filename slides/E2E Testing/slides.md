## Let's talk about 

-
-
-

## **testing**

---

## **e2e** testing

---

## testing

-

## **The real thing**

---

## E2E testing is done

-

## **Manually**

---

## Why, what, and how

-

## should we **automate**?

---

-

# This talk

- My thoughts

- Not technical

- Discussion

- Next steps

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Our **automated** tests

- Unit & Integration

- Mocking

- No E2E

---

### Which is why we 

-
-

### test **manually** as well

---

### However,

-

### Manual testing 

-

### is done by **humans**

---

### **Human** testers have **weaknesses**

inexperienced
unaware
too familiar
assuming
busy
tired
etc.

# Consequence

- reliability

- Consistency

- Coverage

- Regression

---

### Luckily,

-

### Manual testing 

-

### is done by **humans**

---

[.build-lists: true]

-
-

### **Human** testers have **strengths**

- usability,
colors & typography,
intention

- thinking out of the box,
exploratory testing

---

-
-

# Manual testing is **invaluable**

(and so are our testers ❤️)

---

[.build-lists: true]

### **Automated** testing characteristics

- Consistency

- Reliability

- Regression

- Gatekeeping

- Take time

- Browsers

---

So **humans** and **machines** 

both have their

(opposite?)

**strengths** and **weaknesses**,

let's **use** them for the right thing!

---

### **Manual** and **Automated**

-

### testing is **complementary** 

---

[.build-lists: true]

# How to decide between

# **Manual** or **Automated**?

-

- How do I **experience** it?

-

- Does it even **work**?

---

-

# However...

[.build-lists: true]

- It takes time

- Tooling and skills

- Is the feature worth it?

---

-

[.build-lists: true]

# When (not) to automate

- Core functionality

- Hard to automate

- Tradeoffs

---

## Alright...

---

-

enough talking, what are we going to **do**?

# 💪🏻

# Next **steps**

---

-
-

### making and using

[.build-lists: true]

-

# Why?

-

- Consistentency / reliability

- Maintained by everyone

- Progression -> regression

- Transferable knowledge

---

# start building
# **Automated** E2E tests

-

- core functionality

- app vs malong

- POC Cypress vs Playwright

---

-
-

# How far should we go?
