# Time

#### (ask your empoyer, keep it small, fun > time)

# It has already been done before

#### (every person, and their explanation, is unique 🫶)

# I am not an expert

#### (you will become one sooner by starting content creation right now, don't wait)

# Opinions vs Facts

---

# Audience / expectation management

#### (people you know, tell them you are learning)

# The curse of (expert) knowledge

#### (can you still put yourself in the position of your audience?)
