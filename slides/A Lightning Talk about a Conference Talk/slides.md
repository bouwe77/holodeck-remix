# 🥁

# ...a Conference Talk

### (feedback: is it interesting? missing anything?)

---

# Personal experience

---

### Blogging, presenting, streaming, podcasting, Slack, Twitter, etc.

---

# meta... 🤯

# Target audience

### People who think they might wanna start 

### (or do more) content creation

### regarding knowledge sharing and content creation

# Content I create(d)

# Scary

#### (absolutely, but find/start the way that works for you)

---

# Time

#### (ask your employer, keep it small, fun > time)

---

# It has already been done before

#### (every person, and their explanation, is unique 🫶)

---

# I am not an expert

#### (you will become one sooner by starting content creation right now, don't wait)

---

# Opinions vs Facts

---

# Audience / expectation management

#### (people you know, tell them you are learning)

---

# The curse of (expert) knowledge

#### (can you still put yourself in the position of your audience?)

---

# For WHO are creating content?

#### (for yourself perhaps?)
